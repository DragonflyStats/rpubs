The influence of an observation can be thought of in terms of how much the predicted scores for other observations would differ if the observation in question were not included. 

%Cook's D is a good measure of the influence of an observation and is proportional to the sum of the squared differences between predictions made with all observations in the analysis and predictions made leaving out the observation in question. If the predictions are the same with or without the observation in question, then the observation has no influence on the regression model. If the predictions differ greatly when the observation is not included in the analysis, then the observation is influential.


### Influential Points}

An influential point is an outlier that greatly affects the slope of the regression line. One way to test the influence of an outlier is to compute the regression equation with and without the outlier.


If your data set includes an influential point, here are some things to consider.

%----------%


*  An influential point may represent bad data, possibly the result of measurement error. If possible, check the validity of the data point.

*  Compare the decisions that would be made based on regression equations defined with and without the influential point. If the equations lead to contrary decisions, use caution.

%In the context of regression analysis, which of the following statements are true?
%
% I. When the data set includes an influential point, the data set is nonlinear. 
%II. Influential points always reduce the coefficient of determination. 
%III. All outliers are influential data points. 
%
%(A) I only 
%(B) II only 
%(C) III only 
%(D) All of the above 
%(E) None of the above

%Solution
%
%The correct answer is (E). Data sets with influential points can be linear or nonlinear. In this lesson, we went over an example in which an influential point increased the coefficient of determination. With respect to regression, outliers are influential only if they have a big effect on the regression equation. Sometimes, outliers do not have big effects. For example, when the data set is very large, a single outlier may not have a big effect on the regression equation.

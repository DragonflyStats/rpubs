The Poisson Distribution {data-navmenu="Maths"}
===================================

Column
-----------------------------

### Poisson

A Poisson distribution is the probability distribution that results from a Poisson experiment. A Poisson experiment, ,with $X$ as the number of successes, is a statistical experiment that has the following properties: 

#### Attributes of a Poisson Experiment

* The experiment results in outcomes that can be classified as successes or failures.
* The average number of successes ($\lambda$ or lambda) that occurs in a specified region is known.
* The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
* The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero. 

Note that the specified region could take many forms. For instance, it could be a length, an area, a volume, a period of time, etc. The Poisson distribution will feature significantly in the \textbf{\textit{Stochastic Processes}} module that many of you will study in the future.

There are four functions that can be used to generate the values associated with the Poisson distribution. 
The commands follow the same kind of naming convention, and the names of the commands are 
<i><b>dpois()</b></i>, <i><b>ppois()</b></i>, 
<i><b>qpois()</b></i>, and <i><b>rpois()</b></i>.

These commands work just like the commands for the other distribution. The Poisson distribution requires the lambda. parameters. A few examples are given below to show how to use the different commands. First we have the density function, <i><b>dpois()</b></i>.

### Example
Suppose that the expected number of occurences per unit space is 5, compute the probability of exactly 4 and exactly 5 occurences, i.e. $P(X = 4)$ and $P(X = 5)$ respectively.

<pre>
<code>
dpois(4,lambda=5)
dpois(5,lambda=5)
</code>

The probability of both 4 and 5 successes is 17.5\%.
<code>
> dpois(4,lambda=5)
[1] 0.1754674
> dpois(5,lambda=5)
[1] 0.1754674
</code>

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{dpoisPlot}
% \caption{Some function f(x) evaluated at x=1}
\end{center}

This plot was implemented with the following \texttt{R} code.
The upper limit of 15 was arbitrarily chosen. There is no upper bound in the sample space of potential successes.
<pre>
<code>
x = seq(0,15,by=1)
y = dpois(x,lambda=5)
plot(x,y,type="h",col="red",lwd=2,font.lab=2,font.axis=2)
points(x,y,type="p",col="red",cex=1.60,pch=18)
</code>

Compute the probability that the number of successes is less than or equal to 15, i.e. $P(X \leq 15)$. To compute this, we would use the \textbf{\texttt{ppois()</b></i> command. The answer is 99.99\%.

<pre>
<code>
ppois(3,lambda=5)
</code>

<code>
> ppois(15,lambda=5)
[1] 0.999931
</code>

As mentioned previously, the Poisson distribution is particularly useful in simulating stochastic processes, by generating suitable random values.
Suppose the expected number of occurrences is 5 per month. To simulate the number of occurences for two year (i.e. 24 months), we use the <i><b>rpois()</b></i> function.

<code>
> rpois(24,lambda=5)
[1] 4 6 5 6 5 4 7 7 1 2 3 6 7 1 2 6 2 2 7 9 1 4 5 1
</code>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, find the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute (i.e. $P(X\geq 17)$). 

The probability of having sixteen or less cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute is given by the  <i><b>ppois()</b></i> function. 
<code>
> ppois(16, lambda=12)   
[1] 0.89871 
</code>

Hence the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a minute is in the upper tail of the probability density function. 

<code>
> ppois(16, lambda=12, lower=FALSE)   # upper tail 
[1] 0.10129 
</code>

If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute is 10.1\%.

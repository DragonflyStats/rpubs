  The **Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset** is designed to help in developing predictive models to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the dataset:

### Overview:
- **Content:** The dataset includes cleaned customer activity data (features) and a churn label indicating whether a customer has canceled their subscription.
- **Purpose:** Used for developing predictive models to anticipate customer churn.

### Key Features and Columns:
1. **Customer Information:** Data such as customer IDs and demographic details.
2. **Behavior and Usage:** Details on customer behavior, usage statistics, and other relevant metrics.
3. **Service Plans:**
   - **Voice Mail Plan (`vmailplan`):** Indicates if the customer has a voice mail plan.
   - **International Plan (`intlplan`):** Indicates if the customer has an international call plan.
4. **Usage Statistics:**
   - **Day Minutes (`daymins`):** Total minutes of calls during the day.
   - **Day Calls (`daycalls`):** Total number of calls during the day.
   - **Day Charges (`daycharge`):** Charges for the calls during the day.
   - Similar metrics are available for evening, night, and international calls.
5. **Customer Service Interaction:** Number of calls made to customer service (`custservicecalls`).
6. **Churn Indicator (`churned`):** A binary indicator showing whether the customer has churned (1 if churned, 0 otherwise).


### Sample Columns:
- `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `accountdur`: Duration of the customer's account (in months).
- `areacode`: Area code of the customer's phone number.
- `phonenumber`: Customer's phone number.
- `vmailmessage`: Number of voicemail messages.
- `evemins`: Total minutes of calls during the evening.
- `evecalls`: Total number of calls during the evening.
- `evecharge`: Charges for the calls during the evening.
- `nightmins`: Total minutes of calls during the night.
- `nightcalls`: Total number of calls during the night.
- `nightcharge`: Charges for the calls during the night.
- `intlmins`: Total minutes of international calls.
- `intlcalls`: Total number of international calls.
- `intlcharge`: Charges for international calls.

### Example Use Cases:
- **Survival Analysis:** Estimating the time until a customer churns.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Identifying factors that contribute to churn and predicting which customers are likely to churn.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Understanding the distribution of features such as service usage and customer service calls.

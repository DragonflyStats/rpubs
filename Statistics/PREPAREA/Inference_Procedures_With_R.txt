\subsection{Statistical Inference}
\begin{itemize}
\item $R$ commands for statistical inference procedures \item
t.test() - testing procedure for means.
\begin{itemize}
\item One sample \item Two sample \item Paired
\end{itemize}
\item prop.test() - testing procedure for proportions.
\begin{itemize}
\item One sample \item Two sample
\end{itemize}
\item var.test() - testing procedure for variances.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Single sample inference}

If we have a single sample we might want to answer several
questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the mean value? \item Is the mean value
significantly different from current theory? (Hypothesis test)
\item What is the level of uncertainty associated with our
estimate of the mean value? (Confidence interval)
\end{itemize}
To ensure that our analysis is correct we need to check for
outliers in the data (i.e. boxplots) and we also need to check
whether the data are normally distributed or not.

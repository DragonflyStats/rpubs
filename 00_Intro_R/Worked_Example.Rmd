\item 
A test of a specific blood factor has been devised such that, for adults in Western Europe, the test score is normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 10. 
A clinical research organization is carrying out research on the blood factor levels for sufferers of a particular disease.  

\begin{itemize}
\item A study has obtained the following test scores for 14 randomly selected patients suffering from the disease in Ireland 
\[ \{115, 113, 111, 109, 115, 108, 121, 114, 104, 113, 122, 90, 
103, 116\}\]

\item A similar study has obtained the following test scores for 15 randomly selected patients suffering from the disease in Germany .
\[\{120, 137, 114, 120, 116, 118, 101, 110, 125, 113, 111, 128, 
119, 117, 121\}\]

\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 
Sample & Mean & Std. Deviation & Sample Size \\  \hline 
Ireland & 111 & 8.143 & 14 \\ \hline 
Gemany & 118 & 8.350 & 15 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

You believe that there may be a difference in blood factor levels between the two countries. Test this hypothesis using a 5\% level of significance. 
\textit{For the time being, you may assume that assumption of equal variance is valid. }
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses.

\item Compute the pooled standard deviation and/or pooled variance.
\item Compute the test statistic.
\item Discuss your conclusion to this test, supporting your statement with reference to appropriate values.
\end{enumerate}

Markov Chains
In anticipation of future material on course MS4217.
For the purposes of this course, we will assume the initial state is state 1.
#Transition matrix “Tron”
Tron = matrix (c(0.5,0.25,0.25,0.4,0.3,0.3,0.2,0.7,0.1),nrow=3,byrow=TRUE)
rownames(Tron)=c("state1","state2","state3")
colnames(Tron) = rownames(Tron)
 
Assume that the process is currently in state 1. The uniform distribution can be used to compute a random value for probability.
> runif(1)           	                           #return one random value between 0 and 1
[1] 0.6891122
The outcome is between 0.5 and 0.75, therefore the process will migrate to state 2. If the probability value was less than 0.5, the process would have remained in state 1. If the probability was greater than 0.75, the  process would have migrated to state 3.
 
Tron = matrix (c(0.5,0.25,0.25,0.4,0.3,0.3,0.2,0.7,0.1),nrow=3,byrow=TRUE)
#check that each row totals is one.
sum( Tron[1,]) == 1;                sum( Tron[2,]) == 1 ;               sum( Tron[3,]) ==1 ;
#compute upper and lower ‘fences’ for each row.
L1 =Tron[1,1];   	             U1 = Tron[1,1] + Tron[1,2];
